## UB3R-B0T

### The hell is an UB3R-B0T?
UB3R-B0T is primarily a utility bot for Discord and IRC. You can read more about UB3R-B0T as an application and adding to your own servers at https://ub3r.bot

### The code
This repo hosts the main bot application code. Some of it is old and gnarly. Some of it is kind of okay. This repo isn't really intended for use to clone and spin up your own bot. You can certainly try, but there isn't any support provided to do that. It's mostly intended for version control and letting UB3R be an open source buddy. Because bots are buddies. They are our friends. Do not fear the bots.

### I found a bug in the code
You can open an issue in github or swing by the UB3R-B0T Discord server: https://discord.gg/0t6waxpRf4xvyNHj
